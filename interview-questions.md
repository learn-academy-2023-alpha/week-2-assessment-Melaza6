# ASSESSMENT 2: Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory as if you were in a job interview.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

1. What is the difference between a parameter and an argument?

Your answer: Parameters are invoke withing a function while  
arguments are invoke by functions. lol

functions take argument
functions perform actions on parameters

(my answer after wrapping my head around it.)
 Arguments are specific datatypes held by a functon for iteration, and at times areguments can be a function that returns an specifict datatype. While, Paramerters are placeholders in the iteration of a function to an argument given.

Researched answer: Arguemnt are Values declared within a function and parameter are the varibales defined when a function is declared.


2. The JavaScript built in method .map() takes predefined parameters. What are they? Which are required and which are optional?

Your answer: value, index, and array are the predefined parameters. The most required is value while array and index are optional.

Researched answer: It contains three parameter and they are:

* currentValue: It is a required parameter and it holds the value of the current element.
* index: It is an optional parameter and it holds the index of the current element.
* arr: It is an optional parameter and it holds the array.



3. What is the difference between map and filter?

Your answer: Mapping returns an iteration to every element within an array, while filtering returns an iteration to those elements if"{if}" and only if"[{else if}, esle}]" certain condtion"= ['conditionalStatment']" return is true"[Boolean]".

Researched answer: Map: returns and array with informations from the original array, in the callback function, returns a new array with the information you provided
Filter: returns a portion of the orginal array bose on the information you provided.

1. What is iteration?

Your answer: An action perforn on an specific datatype that can make it return as a diffrent datatype. 

Researched answer: it happens when executing conde on a collection of items, normally elements in an arrry or the properties of an object.

1. What is the difference between a function and a method?

Your answer: In a function developers can alter the iteration returning on the parameters of an argument, while methods perform an specific iteration toan argument. 
Researched answer: A function can pass data that is operated and may return the data. Data passed must be straightforward. A method implicitly passes the object on which it was called.


6. STRETCH: What is hoisting in JavaScript?

Your answer: I don't know at the moment, but would love to do some researched and give you my answer. 

Researched answer: Is the behavior of moving declarations to the top in JavaScript, allowing the used of functions and variables before being declared.

*Student Note*
Before answering any interview question the student will read all the questions and answer all "Your answer:" sections of the quesions prior to answering any "Researched Answer" sections of the questions, to avoid research on the subject and its vocabulary. After all "Your Answer" sections have been answer the student begging research and answering the "Researched answer" sections of the questions. The student will use this .method() to optimize the understanding the subject and it's vocabulary. 



"By answering the "Your Answer" section of questions prior to beggining research, the student is{}/isNot{} understanding the subject and it's vocabulary."

## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week

Research and define the following terms to the best of your ability.

1. Classes: Help create objects. They encapsulate data with code to work on that data. Classes in JS are built on prototypes but also have some syntax and semantics that are unique to classes

2. Spread operator: allows us to quickly copy all or part of an existing array or object into another array or object.

3. React state: Data that can be modified by its own components 

4. React props: Data that cannot be modified, and serves as read-only

5. DOM events:  actions that occur by users on HTML based on code created.
